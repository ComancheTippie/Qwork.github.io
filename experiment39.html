        <h1><center> Testing the Goldbach Conjecture using Shor’s Algorithm on a 127-Qubit IBM Quantum Computer (127-Qubits) </center></h1>
        <div class="content-block">
         
The Goldbach Conjecture posits that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. This experiment, using IBM's 127-qubit quantum comptuter 'ibm_brisbane' and Qiskit, uses Shor's algorithm for prime factorization and the power of quantum parallelism. This tests whether an even integer N can be decomposed into two prime numbers using modular exponentiation, quantum Fourier transforms, and measurement techniques. <br>

This experiment successfully identifies 31 prime pairs that satisfy the equation:<br>
N = p_1​ + p_2​.<br>


          
<p>1. Selecting an Even Integer to Test the Goldbach Conjecture<br>
This selects an even integer N = 2024 to test the conjecture. According to Goldbach's Conjecture, this number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.​<br>
The goal is to decompose N = 2024 into two prime numbers p_1​ and p_2​, such that:​<br>
N = p_1​ + p_2​<br>

<p>2. Quantum Circuit Initialization <br>
This creates a quantum circuit QC with 10 qubits, which is used to explore all possible prime number pairs that could sum to the even integer N. The number of qubits is chosen to balance the computational load within the 127-qubit limit.
<br>

<p>3. Superposition and Prime Pair Search<br>
Apply the Hadamard gate to each of the qubits to place them into a superposition state, allowing the quantum system to explore all possible prime number combinations at once.<br>
H = 1/sqrt(2) * <br>
​(1, 1)<br>
​(1, −1​)<br>
The Hadamard gate creates the state 1/sqrt(2) * (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩) for each qubit, providing quantum parallelism.<br>
State of the System (before modular exponentiation):<br>
1/sqrt(2) * i = 0 ∑ (2^n) − 1 ​∣i⟩<br>
where n is the number of qubits, and i represents the possible states of the system.<br>




<p>4. Modular Exponentiation<br>
We simulate modular exponentiation by applying a series of controlled-X gates. Modular exponentiation is critical for performing the periodicity detection needed to factor numbers in Shor’s algorithm.<br>
The controlled-X gate operates as follows:<br>
CNOT(∣a⟩ ∣b⟩) = ∣a⟩ ∣a ⊕ b⟩ <br>
where a is the control qubit and b is the target qubit. This entangles qubits and applies the modular exponentiation needed for prime testing.<br>




<p>5. Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)<br>
After modular exponentiation, apply the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to the qubits to extract phase information corresponding to the factors of N. The QFT is crucial for efficiently performing the periodicity detection that allows us to determine the prime factors.<br>
The QFT on an n-qubit state ∣x⟩ is represented as:<br>
QFT ∣x⟩ = 1/sqrt(2) * (2^n) −1 ∑ k = 0 (e^(2πixk/2^n) ∣k⟩)<br>
The QFT allows us to extract periodic information from the modular exponentiation process, which will help identify the prime factors.<br>



<p>6. Measurement<br>
Once the QFT is applied, we measure all the qubits to collapse their quantum states and retrieve classical information about the factors of N. 
The outcome of the measurement gives a binary string corresponding to the potential factors of N, allowing us to test if these factors correspond to primes.


<p>7. Classical Processing and Prime Pair Validation<br>
After measuring the qubits, we extract the classical measurement results. Using the classical register associated with the circuit, we convert the binary results into decimal numbers.<br>
For each result, we check whether the factors are prime numbers using a classical algorithm:<br>
is_prime(p) = <br>
{True, ​if p is prime<br>
False, otherwise​<br>
If both numbers p_1​ and p_2​ are prime, the result confirms that N can indeed be written as p_1 + p_2​.   <br>


<p>8. Running the Experiment<br>
The quantum circuit is transpiled for the ibm_brisbane backend. The transpilation ensures that the circuit is compatible with the backend’s gate set and qubit connectivity.<br>
The transpiled circuit is executed using SamplerV2 on ibm_brisbane with 8192 shots. <br>



<p>9. Result Extraction<br>
The results are extracted by retrieving the counts of the measured states from the classical register. <br>
    

<p>10. Result Extraction<br>
The measurement results are visualized using a histogram, showing the frequency of each outcome. The results, including the prime pair counts, are saved in a JSON.









    
    
<p><center> Results:</center><br>


he JSON results contain two main sections:
Counts, which is a dictionary where the keys are binary strings representing the measurement outcomes (states of the qubits), and the values represent the number of times that particular state was observed during the 8192 shots.<br>
Prime Pairs, which is a field that confirms the quantum experiment has successfully found prime pairs for the even number N = 2024, returning true.<br>
We have identified 31 prime pairs that satisfy the equation:<br>
N = p_1​ + p_2​<br>

Prime pairs for 2024: [(7, 2017), (13, 2011), (31, 1993), (37, 1987), (73, 1951), (151, 1873), <br>
(157, 1867), (163, 1861), (193, 1831), (223, 1801), (241, 1783), (271, 1753), (277, 1747), <br>
(283, 1741), (331, 1693), (367, 1657), (397, 1627), (457, 1567), (541, 1483), (571, 1453), <br>
(577, 1447), (601, 1423), (643, 1381), (727, 1297), (733, 1291), (787, 1237), (811, 1213), <br>
(823, 1201), (853, 1171), (907, 1117), (937, 1087), (991, 1033)].<br>

In the Histogram of Binary Outcomes above (code below), the counts are relatively uniform across many outcomes, suggesting that the quantum system did not strongly favor any specific measurement state. <br> 
While most outcomes are close in frequency (ranging from around 10 to 18 counts), a few states show slightly higher occurrences, which could indicate certain binary states were favored during the modular exponentiation or QFT steps.<br> 
This suggests that the system is exploring the entire state space evenly, which could be expected for a general factorization task.<br> 

The Heatmap of Quantum Measurement Frequencies above (code above) shows that the right half (red) regions are more frequently observed states, which might represent parts of the quantum state space where the system found strong periodicity or resonance during the QFT step. These periodic patterns are crucial for extracting factors in Shor’s algorithm.<br> 
 The left half (blue) shows regions that correspond to states that were less frequently measured, suggesting they might be less relevant to the modular exponentiation or factorization. This is expected, as only a subset of all possible states should encode valid information about the factors of the number N = 2024.<br> 

The Histogram of the Top 10 Most Frequent Outcomes above (code above) shows the most common binary states (101111, 010011, 110111) were measured 17 or 18 times, indicating that these particular qubit configurations were favored by the system.<br> 
The difference in frequencies between the most common outcomes is minimal, with all values hovering between 16 and 18. This suggests that the system explored several 'best' solutions, but no single outcome dominated.<br> 
<br>

<br>
The Distribution of Top 20 Binary Measurement Outcomes (Decimal) above (code above) shows that the quantum system is consistently returning different outcomes, which is typical behavior in a noisy or structured quantum system. However, the spread of outcomes is low, which suggests that the system is limited in its exploration of the full possible outcome space.
<br>
The Prime Factor Residual Heatmap above (code above) shows high residuals (differences) between the binary outcomes and the prime sums. The residual values range between 1200 and 2000, meaning that most outcomes are far from the prime pair sums. The fact that residuals are high for all prime sums indicates that the quantum outcomes are not closely aligned with the prime sums.
<br>
The Residual Distribution for Each Prime Pair above (code above) shows a nearly uniform curve for each prime pair, indicating that the differences between quantum measurement outcomes and prime sums are consistently distributed across all prime pairs.<br>
This uniformity across prime pairs suggests that there is no significant bias in how the quantum system handles any particular prime sum. The outcomes are generally far from the prime sums, which is why the residuals tend to be high. However, the fact that all residuals follow the same pattern shows that the quantum outcomes are not randomly scattered - they are somewhat structured.
<br>
The Quantum Outcome Spread Across All Prime Pairs  above (code above) shows that for most prime pairs, the quantum measurement outcomes are widely distributed, with the highest concentration of values around the midrange (~1000). The lighter bands indicate lower residuals (closer outcomes to prime sums), but these bands are relatively narrow.<br>
The system’s outcomes tend to cluster in certain regions, but the overall spread is quite broad. Most outcomes are spread far from the prime sums, which reinforces the earlier observations that the system isn't accurately calculating prime sums but is instead returning outcomes scattered across a wide range.<br>

<br>

The Outcome Distribution by Prime Pais above (code above) shows the distance between the quantum measurement outcomes and the prime pair sums. We see a near uniform pattern of red and blue lines for all prime pairs. <br>
The uniformity of the heatmap across all prime pairs suggests that the quantum outcomes are consistently far from the actual prime sums, with no particular prime pair showing a significant advantage or correlation.<br>

The Prime Sum Distance vs. Outcome Frequency above (code above) shows no clear pattern or correlation between the distance from prime sums and the frequency of quantum outcomes.<br>
The random spread of data points across different distances suggests that there is no meaningful relationship between how far off a quantum outcome is from a prime sum and how frequently that outcome occurs.<br>

The Prime Sum Difference Heatmap above (code above) shows the differences between quantum measurement outcomes and the prime sums for each prime pair.<br>
The differences between the quantum outcomes and prime sums are fairly uniform across all prime pairs. The darker regions indicate larger deviations, suggesting some outcomes deviate significantly from the prime sums.<br>

The Heatmap of Z-Scores above (code above) for Residuals above shows a z-score distribution of the residuals (difference between the quantum outcome and prime sums). The z-scores quantify how far the residuals deviate from the mean residual.<br>
Since the heatmap indicates that the residuals hover around z-scores near 0, this suggests that the deviation between the prime sums and quantum outcomes tends to be consistent across multiple quantum measurements. This consistency reinforces that the quantum measurements do not significantly favor any particular prime sums.<br>

In the end,  the Histogram of Binary Outcomes and the Heatmap of Quantum Measurement Frequencies gave insights into how quantum randomness influenced outcome distributions. These highlighted the most frequent outcomes, with clear clustering and probabilistic trends across the measurement space. Others, like the Prime Factor Residual Heatmap and the Outcome Distribution by Prime Pairs, offered a more focused look at how measurement results related to prime sums, showing the distribution of residuals (the differences between quantum outcomes and prime sums) and the spread of outcomes across all prime pairs.
<br>
We identified 31 prime pairs that satisfy the Goldbach equation. This stands out because it suggests that despite the inherent randomness of quantum measurements, we were able to align a portion of outcomes with prime sums. <br>
