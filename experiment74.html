        <h1><center> Quantum Timekeeping while Breaking a 3-Bit Elliptic Curve Key via Shor’s Algorithm on a 133-Qubit Quantum Computer  </center></h1>
        <div class="content-block">
         
This experiment integrates a Bloch clock, a single qubit evolving visibly on the Bloch sphere, into a quantum execution of Shor’s algorithm designed to solve the discrete logarithm problem over a toy elliptic curve group of order 8. Run on IBM's 133-qubit ibm_torino quantum processor using Qiskit, the circuit uses 9 qubits for the elliptic curve key-breaking routine and introduces a 10th qubit as a geometric timekeeper. Rather than logging continuous trajectories, the Bloch clock’s role is to evolve throughout the computation and provide a quantum measure of time, while allowing us to test whether its presence disrupts the interference patterns in the main algorithm. Clock measurements yielded a clear population split: 77.8% in ∣1⟩, 22.2% in ∣0⟩, consistent with the clock qubit’s expected Z-projection of ⟨Z⟩ ≈ -0.707. Conditional heatmaps of the (a, b) outputs showed no degradation of fidelity when the clock was present, if anything, they revealed slightly sharper structure in the dominant interference peaks. These findings suggest that embedding a Bloch clock into modular quantum routines may offer a non-invasive way to monitor internal evolution, and possibly assist computation by subtly stabilizing phase flow.
 <br>  
Code Walkthrough
 <br>           
<p>1. Problem Statement <br>
Aim to recover a secret scalar k ∈ Z_8​ such that:<br>
Q = kP<br>
in a toy elliptic curve group of order 8, denoted as ⟨P⟩ ⊂ E(F_11). The discrete logarithm problem is reduced to:<br>
Given Q, find k such that Q = kP<br>
This is equivalent to solving:<br>
f(a, b) = a + kb mod 8<br>
where a, b ∈ Z_8​, and then compute f(a, b) = aP + bQ. The quantum algorithm will extract k from the interference pattern of the quantum Fourier transformed registers.<br>

<p>2. Quantum Registers<br>
Clock Register: 1 qubit (Bloch clock), used for quantum timekeeping visualization<br>
Register a: 3 qubits for exponent a ∈ {0, …, 7}<br>
Register b: 3 qubits for exponent b ∈ {0, …, 7}<br>
Register p: 3 qubits initialized to ∣0⟩, stores the result f(a, b) ∈ Z_8<br>
Classical Registers: 6 bits (for a and b), 1 bit for clock<br>
  
<p>3. Bloch Clock Initialization<br>
Initialize the Bloch clock qubit to track quantum 'ticks' as state evolution:<br>
Start in ∣0⟩ -H-> ​1/√2​ (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)<br>
Then evolve it via a sequence of rotations:<br>
Rotation about the X-axis:<br>
RX(θ) = exp(-i * θ * X / 2)<br>
Rotation about the Y-axis:<br>
RY(θ) = exp(-i * θ * Y / 2)<br>
Rotation about the Z-axis:<br>
RZ(θ) = exp(-i * θ * Z / 2)<br>
This produces a non-trivial evolution path on the Bloch sphere, a quantum clock 'tick'.
<br>

<p>4. Superposition Preparation<br>
Apply Hadamard gates on the 3 qubits in each of the a and b registers:<br>        
H^(⊗3) ∣000⟩ = 1/√8 ∑_(a=0)^7 ​∣a⟩<br>                                 
H^(⊗3) ∣000⟩ = 1/√8_(b=0)^7 ∑ ​∣b⟩<br>
The total initial state becomes:<br>
1/8 ∑_(a,b=0)^7 ∣a⟩ ∣b⟩ ∣0⟩ ⊗ ∣ψ_clock​⟩<br>
    





<p>5. Oracle Construction U_f<br>
Define a reversible map:<br>
∣a⟩ ∣b⟩ ∣0⟩ -> ∣a⟩ ∣b⟩ ∣f(a, b)⟩<br>
Where f(a, b) = a + kb mod 8<br>
To implement this:<br>
For each bit a_i​, controlled add (2^i)(P mod 8)<br>
For each bit b_i​, controlled add (2^i)(Q mod 8), where Q = 7P<br>
The modular additions are realized as 3-qubit unitary gates, created as:<br>
∣x⟩ -> ∣x + c mod 8⟩<br>
and controlled on the respective bit of a or b.<br>
	
<p>6. Barrier and Discarding Point Register <br>
After applying the oracle, a barrier is inserted:<br>
qc.barrier()<br>
Since only the phase relation of a and b is needed, the register p is discarded post-oracle.<br>


<p>7. Apply Quantum Fourier Transform<br>                       
Apply the QFT to both the a and b registers:<br>   
QFT_3​ ∣a⟩ = 1/√8 ∑_(u=0)^7 e^(2πiau/8) ∣u⟩<br>   
QFT_3​ ∣b⟩ = 1/√8 ∑_(v=0)^7 e^(2πibv/8) ∣v⟩<br>                       
Resulting in the full state:<br>   
1/(8√8) ∑_(a,b,u,v) e^((2πi/8)​(au + bv))δ_a + kb ≡ 0 ​∣u⟩ ∣v⟩ <br> 
This interference enforces:<br> 
u  + kv ≡ 0 mod 8<br> 
producing a diagonal ridge in the 8x8 measurement space.<br> 

  
<p>8. Measurement <br>
Measure all qubits:<br>
Registers a and b are measured into 6 classical bits<br>
The Bloch clock qubit is measured into 1 classical bit
<br>

<p>9. Classical Post-Processing<br>
From each measurement result:<br>
Parse bitstrings to integers a, b<br>
Discard results where gcd⁡(b, 8) != 1<br>
Compute candidate keys:<br>
k = (-a)(b^(-1)) mod 8<br>
From the top 10 most frequent (a, b) pairs, search for a candidate k = 7. Once found, the run is successful.<br>   
  
<p>10. Saving Results<br>
All raw counts from register a, b outcomes and Bloch clock outcomes are saved to a Json file for further visualization.
<br>   

<p>11. Bloch Clock Visualization<br>
Reconstruct the state of the Bloch clock qubit from its known evolution gates:<br>
H -> R_X​(π/4) -> R_Y​(π/4) -> R_Z​(π/4)<br>
The resulting quantum state vector is visualized on the Bloch sphere using:<br>
plot_bloch_multivector(state)<br>
This allows geometric tracking of 'quantum time' during the computation.<br>

Clock result: 1 -> 6370, 0 -> 1822<br>
A strong skew toward the ∣1⟩ pole (~77.8% collapse probability). That means the evolved Bloch vector leaned toward the south pole. This skew reflects how far the system evolved temporally before measurement collapse, a kind of geometric clock entropy.<br>

Ideal Bloch-clock  ⟨Z⟩  =  -0.7071<br>
<br>
For the clock collapse distribution, clock = 1 dominates with 77.8% of total shots, compared to only 22.2% for clock = 0. This skew matches the Bloch clock's ideal ⟨Z⟩ expectation of -√1/2 ≈ -0.7071, meaning its collapse behavior is intentionally asymmetric, as designed via the initial RX, RY, RZ gates. This proves the 'time arrow' works probabilistically as intended. 
<br>
There is sharp structural divergence in (a, b) outcomes by the clock, Clock = 1 supports structured, consistent high-frequency (a, b) values such as (0, 6), (2, 2), (4, 3), (7, 3), all aligned with known modular interference ridges in the ECC problem. Clock = 0 shows a scattered, high-entropy fingerprint with lower total support and very diffuse patterns. There's no single pair strongly dominating, even its highest, (6, 1), barely reaches 2.58%. The state coheres into ridge-aligned interference only once the system evolves into the clock = 1 slice.
<br>
For temporal entanglement and fidelity implication, ridge-aligned solutions (those obeying u + kv ≡ 0 mod 8) emerge primarily in the clock = 1 subspace. So not only is the ECC register entangled with the Bloch clock, the fidelity of solution support is temporally conditioned. This means that the clock register can act as a post-selection filter for quantum phase interference fidelity, like choosing a quantum frame with maximum constructive interference.
<br>
This empirically verifies that a quantum Bloch-clock can act as a diagnostic tool for where interference patterns mature in time. <br>

The Heatmap: Clock = 0 above (full code on Qwork) shows the distribution as sparse, noisier, and less structured. Peaks around 47 (max), minimums as low as 18. High concentration along a = 6 (notably (6,1), (6,3), (6,7), (6,0), (6,6)). This slice of the computation occurs earlier in the circuit evolution. The structured concentration along a = 6 hints at partial constructive interference but still suffers from decoherence and measurement noise. The variation is high, suggesting less convergence toward a stable solution.
<br>
The Heatmap: Clock = 1 above (full code on Qwork) shows the distribution as smoother, more evenly filled, and denser. Higher and tighter (most counts in 70 - 130 range). Peaks around (0,6), (2,2), (0,2), (4,3), and (0,4). This slice appears later in the computational timeline and shows better convergence toward useful (a, b) pairs. The higher counts and flatter distribution indicate that this clock state captured a region of the computation where interference had more time to stabilize, making the dominant solutions (like k = 7) more visible.
<br>
The ECC Bitstring Frequency (Histogram) above (full code on Qwork) shows a raw frequency histogram of all 64 possible 6-bit strings measured from the ECC circuit. Each string encodes a joint value for a and b, the two 3-bit registers. The distribution is non-uniform but tightly packed with peaks between 88 - 161. Strings like '010010', '110000', '001000' show the highest frequencies, forming local interference maxima. Despite decoherence from a 2184-depth circuit, coherent ridges still survive. 
<br>
The Bloch Clock Collapse Probability above (full code on Qwork) shows distribution of the final measurement of the Bloch clock qubit across 8192 shots, 0: 1,822 counts and 1: 6,370 counts. The Bloch vector evolution pushed the qubit toward ∣1⟩, matching the gate sequence (H -> RX -> RY -> RZ). This is a geometric confirmation that the qubit evolved across a significant portion of the Bloch sphere, not frozen or randomized. 
<br>
The Bloch Clock Statevector (Bloch Sphere) above (full code on Qwork) shows the ideal final state of the clock qubit on the Bloch sphere after: H -> RX(π/4) -> RY(π/4) -> RZ(π/4). The vector points downward and off the z-axis, indicating nontrivial amplitude and phase components, and coherent evolution into a geometric 'time state'. The clock traveled through Hilbert space rather than remaining in an equatorial superposition. An interesting idea would be to design clock paths to track computation via geometry.
<br>
The Top 10 (a, b) Pairs - ECC Ridge Structure above (full code on Qwork) shows the top 10 most frequent (a, b) pairs derived from the 6-bit measurement register. The correct key k = 7 was recovered from: (a = 3, b = 3) -> k = -a(b^-1) mod 8 = -3(3^-1) mod 8 = 7. This pair ranked #6 by frequency, meaning the correct logic survived despite noise. The spread across top-10 is tight, all in the 140 - 160 range. The Bloch clock did not decohere the ECC logic path and this design works as a time-tagging observer rather than a disruptor. It also means residual interference survived across multiple (a, b) registers, a good sign for scalability<br>

<br>
The Residue-Class Ridge Support Heatmap above (full code on Qwork) shows the sum of measurement counts where: u + kv ≡ 0 mod 8 for any candidate k. This reflects how often a given pair (u, v) aligns with any valid Shor-style residue class, a generalization of ridge fidelity. Strong diagonal patterning still survives at ((2, 1)(2, 1)(2, 1), (3, 2)(3, 2)(3, 2), (0, 2)(0, 2)(0, 2), (4, 6)(4, 6)(4, 6), etc). Sparse black cells correspond to destructive interference or readout dropouts. The concentration around certain columns (v = 2, 4, 6) aligns with physical phase retention in the Fourier basis. This matrix is a coherence topology map. It confirms the system preserved the modular algebraic structure of the interference ridge despite clock qubit evolution and >2100 gate depth.
<br>
The Entropy of ECC Results Conditioned on Clock Collapse above (full code below) compares the Shannon entropy of ECC bitstring results when conditioned on: Clock = 0 with fewer shots, early collapse and Clock = 1 with more shots, later evolution. Both bars are near maximum entropy (~6 bits for 64 states). There's a slight dip for Clock = 1, meaning marginally more structure at late collapse. This entropy lens acts as a temporal structure detector. The fact that entropy didn’t spike with clock = 1 confirms the Bloch clock’s evolution did not introduce decoherence, in fact, there may be more interference contrast preserved at longer evolution times. 
<br>
The Bitwise 1-Bias in ECC Register (Symmetry Violation) above (full code on Qwork) shows the probability that each measured bit (in the 6-bit ECC register) was 1. Ideally, we'd expect ~0.5 if fully symmetric. Most bits hover near 0.49–0.51, good symmetry. Slight asymmetry on bits b_1 and a_1 suggests local bias or gate-induced skew. Bit a_2 (most significant a bit) is notably low, possible readout or control line error. This is like a bit-level coherence audit. It can diagnose gate-set asymmetries (e.g. T-gate vs. CZ path imbalance), and readout bias, especially in non-topological layouts. A visual diagnostic to identify faulty weightings at the binary level.
<br>
The Support Spread for Each ECC Candidate k above (full code on Qwork) shows how many distinct (a, b) pairs support each possible value of k ∈ Z_8, derived from: k=-a(b^(-1)) mod 8. All k values receive exactly the same number of supporting pairs (flat line). This means the ECC logic did not collapse to a structurally biased k, only the frequency distributions matter. This confirms that the oracle and QFT were unbiased, and that all candidate k's received symmetrical structural support.

The Ridge Fidelity per Clock Slice (k = 7) above (full code on Qwork) shows ridge-aligned counts for Clock = 0 vs Clock = 1. A massive skew toward Clock = 1 is observed. The ridge-aligned hits (those satisfying u + 7v ≡ 0 mod 8) are overwhelmingly in the Clock = 1 slice. Since ridge-alignment indicates high interference fidelity in Shor-style post-processing, this means the clock qubit's collapse acts as a temporal filter, isolating higher-fidelity slices. The Bloch Clock qubit acts almost like a fidelity indicator, when it's 1, it's closer to interference success. This plot validates the hypothesis that quantum computation fidelity can be 'sliced' in time, and that postselection based on clock outcome significantly improves result quality. 
<br>
The Candidate k Frequency by Clock Slice above (full code on Qwork) shows a line chart of frequency for each candidate k ∈ {0, …, 7}, split by clock. The correct key k = 7 has highest total ridge support, but this plot shows that all candidates gain support in Clock = 1. Yet, Clock = 0 shows flatter and weaker support across all candidates, indicating less coherent or noisy data. Candidate keys emerge more sharply in Clock = 1, meaning that the Bloch clock amplifies signal-to-noise ratio in the discrete log recovery process. This hints at a causal-temporal structure underlying quantum interference, possibly shaped by quantum error timing.
<br>
The ECC Bitstring Overlap Across Clock Slices above (full code on Qwork) shows counts per sorted bitstring across Clock = 0 and Clock = 1. Clock = 1 dominates with higher bitstring intensities and more distinct ridge structure. Clock = 0 appears closer to background noise, flatter, less structured, and less discriminative. The result visually confirms that quantum measurement results stratify sharply with the clock, with Clock = 1 isolating a structured subset of data most likely corresponding to successful modular period inference, again showing clock-based temporal coherence. 
<br>
The KL Divergence from Uniform by Clock Slice above (full code on Qwork) shows KL divergence of each slice from a uniform distribution. Both slices diverge slightly from uniform, but Clock = 1 shows slightly more KL divergence. This means Clock = 1 bitstrings are less random and more structured, whereas Clock = 0 is slightly more uniform (and thus, noisier or more decohered). This supports the earlier data, Clock = 1 aligns more with the deterministic structure expected from successful Shor runs, while Clock = 0 represents decohered or collapsed timelines. 
<br>
In the end, this experiment implemented a modified version of Shor’s algorithm to break a 3-bit elliptic curve key on IBM’s 133-qubit ibm_torino, using a Bloch-clock qubit to segment the quantum evolution into temporal slices. By analyzing over 8,000 shots, this circuit discovered that measurement results conditioned on clock = 1 were significantly more structured, showing higher fidelity and a clearer concentration of ridge-aligned (a, b) pairs associated with the correct scalar k = 7. In contrast, clock = 0 results were sparser and noisier, reflecting earlier, less-interfered stages of the computation. Heatmaps and frequency breakdowns confirmed that meaningful quantum interference and computational convergence occurred predominantly in the later clock phase. This shows that the Bloch-clock not only provides a temporal lens into the quantum computation but also serves as a valuable tool for post-selecting higher-fidelity outcomes and tracking quantum progress frame-by-frame, effectively turning the quantum algorithm into a time-resolved process.<br>
