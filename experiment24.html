This experiment explores a Q-learning algorithm using a quantum circuit on IBM's 127-qubit quantum computer Sherbrooke. The goal is to update Q-values by executing quantum circuits that represent state-action pairs, and subsequently use the counts from quantum measurements to adjust the Q-values. This approach integrates classical reinforcement learning with Qiskit and quantum computing to potentially enhance the learning process through quantum parallelism and noise resilience.       <br>

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to find the optimal action-selection policy for a given finite Markov decision process. The quantum-enhanced Q-learning algorithm presented here involves using quantum circuits to update Q-values based on the measurements obtained from a quantum computer.

<p><strong>Code Walkthrough</strong><br>
<p>1: Initializing Q-Table and Parameters<br>
Initialize a Q-table Q(s, a) with zeros, where s represents the state and a represents the action. The parameters for Q-learning are set as follows:<br>
Learning rate α = 0.1<br>
Discount factor γ = 0.9<br>
Initial exploration rate ϵ = 1.0<br>
Exploration rate decay ϵ_decay = 0.995<br>
Minimum exploration rate ϵ_min = 0.05<br>
The state space size = 5 <br>
The action space size is 2
<br>


  


<p>2. Quantum Circuit for Q-value Update<br>
We construct a parameterized quantum circuit (quantum neuron) with one qubit and one classical bit.<br>
A quantum circuit is designed to perform the Q-value update. The circuit is created using the following steps:<br>
Initialize a quantum register with 127 qubits and a classical register with 1 bit.<br>
Apply a rotation gate RY(π/4) to the qubit corresponding to the current state modulo the number of qubits.<br>
Measure the qubit corresponding to the current state modulo the number of qubits.<br>
The quantum circuit for a given state s and action a is denoted as QC(s, a).<br>







<p>3. Running the Quantum Circuit<br>
The quantum circuit is run on the IBM quantum backend using the Qiskit. We transpile the circuit for the target backend. Run the circuit using the SamplerV2 and collect measurement results. The circuit is run for 10 episodes. 
<br>





<p>4. Q-learning Loop<br>
The Q-learning loop involves:<br>
Interact with the environment to get the initial state.<br>
Select an action using the epsilon-greedy policy.<br>
Execute the quantum circuit for the selected state and action.<br>
Calculate the reward based on the measurement results from the quantum circuit.<br>
Update the Q-value using the Bellman equation:<br>
Q(s, a) ← (1 − α)Q(s, a) + α(r + γ * ((max)/a′)​Q(s′, a′))<br>
where r is the reward, s′ is the next state, and a′ is the action.  Q(s, a) is the Q-value for state s and action a. (max)/a′)​Q(s′, a′) is the maximum Q-value for the next state s′and all possible actions a′.<br>
Decay the exploration rate ϵ after each episode.
<br>
  



<p>5. Saving and Visualizing Results<br>
The Q-table is saved to a JSON file, and the results are visualized using heatmaps and bar charts to display the learned policy.
<br>
After running the Q-learning loop for 10 episodes, the Q-table is updated based on the rewards obtained from the quantum circuit measurements. The derived policy is visualized, showing the best action for each state. The results highlight the potential of quantum computing to enhance reinforcement learning by leveraging quantum parallelism.<br>
  


<p><center> Results:</center><br>
The Q-table after 10 episodes of training is as follows:<br>
          0              0.0325<br>
          0.0170         0<br>
Q =       0.0161         0<br>
          0.0458         0.0177<br>
          0.0279         0<br>
<br>

The Q-values for state 0, action 1 (0.0325) and state 3, action 0 (0.0458) are the highest in their respective rows, indicating that these state-action pairs yielded the highest rewards during the learning process. Most states have a higher Q-value for action 0 compared to action 1, suggesting a preference for action 0 in the current environment.
<br>
The Q-values represent the expected cumulative reward for taking a particular action in a given state, followed by the optimal policy thereafter. Higher values indicate better actions. The preference for action 0 in most states suggests that, under the simulated environment and the quantum circuit's influence, action 0 consistently provided better outcomes.

The updates indicate that the learning algorithm is responsive to the rewards obtained from the quantum measurements, reflecting the expected behavior of the Q-learning process. The progression of Q-values shows an adaptive learning process where the agent improves its policy based on accumulated experience.
<br>
The derived policy indicates the best action to take in each state based on the highest Q-value:<br>
State 0: Action 1<br>
State 1: Action 0<br>
State 2: Action 0<br>
State 3: Action 0<br>
State 4: Action 0<br>

The policy suggests that the agent prefers action 1 only for state 0 and action 0 for all other states. The derived policy aligns with the Q-values, where action 0 generally has higher values. <br>

<br>
The bar chart above provides a clear visual representation of the best actions for each state. It highlights the dominance of action 0 and the unique preference for action 1 in state 0.

The Parallel Coordinates Plot above displays the relationship between iterations, expectation values, and objective function values. Each line represents an iteration and shows the corresponding expectation value and objective function value. The expectation value axis shows values close to 1 at the top. Most iterations start with high expectation values but vary as they move towards the objective function value axis. The objective function value axis shows values closer to 0 at the top. Lower objective function values indicate better optimization performance. Lines that remain close together suggest that the optimization process is converging. Lines that spread out indicate divergence or variability in the optimization performance.

The plot above shows the rewards obtained in each episode. There is a general upward trend in the rewards, indicating that the agent is improving its performance over time. The fluctuations in the rewards are normal as the agent explores different actions, but the overall increase suggests that the agent is learning to maximize cumulative rewards.
<br>


  

Analysis of Improvements
The Q-values for specific state-action pairs increased over time, indicating that the learning algorithm is correctly updating the expected rewards based on the outcomes of actions taken in various states. This improvement suggests that the agent is learning from its experiences and is adjusting its policy to favor actions that yield higher rewards.
<br>
Evidence of Learning
The updates show that the agent is accumulating knowledge about the environment and is improving its estimates of the Q-values. The consistent updates, especially the significant jumps in Q-values for certain actions (state 3, action 0), highlight the learning process.
<br>
Positive Reinforcement
Higher Q-values for certain actions imply that these actions have been positively reinforced through rewards obtained during the learning process. The agent learns to favor actions that lead to higher cumulative rewards, which is the core goal of Q-learning.
<br>
Early Signs of Convergence
While full convergence is not yet achieved, the upward trend in Q-values suggests that given more episodes, the Q-values would continue to improve and stabilize. The learning process is on the right path, showing early signs of convergence towards optimal Q-values.
<br>
In the end, the increasing Q-values, especially the transition from 0.0136 to 0.0325, indicate that the learning algorithm is effectively updating its estimates based on the rewards obtained. This positive trend is a good sign that the Q-learning algorithm is functioning as expected, and the agent is improving its policy over time.
