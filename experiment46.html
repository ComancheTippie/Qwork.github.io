        <h1><center> Drone Delivery Route Optimization on IBM’s 127-Qubit Quantum Computer </center></h1>
        <div class="content-block">
         
This experiment uses quantum computing to optimize delivery routes for a fleet of drones by leveraging the principles of superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference to evaluate multiple potential routes simultaneously. Delivery locations are mapped onto qubits, and costs are encoded as rotations on a Bloch sphere. The experiment simulates dependencies between locations and determines the optimal route using IBM's 'ibm_brisbane' 127-Qubit quantum computer / qiskit. Results are derived from measured quantum states, yielding the most efficient delivery sequence.<br>
<br>
          
<p>1. Problem <br>
The objective is to optimize drone delivery routes by minimizing an overall cost function. Let:<br>
N be the number of delivery locations.<br>
q_i​ represent the i-th delivery location.<br>
C denote the total cost, calculated as:<br>
      N − 1 <br>
C = ∑  (d(q_i, q_(i + 1))) <br>
       i = 1<br>
where d(q_i​, q_(1 + 1)​) is the distance between locations q_i​ and q_(i + 1).
​<br>

<p>2: Calibration Data and Qubit Selection<br>
To ensure reliable computations:<br>
Calibration data from the backend is loaded.<br>
Qubits are ranked based on their sqrt(X) (sx) error, T_1​ (relaxation time), and T_2​ (decoherence time) metrics.<br>
The best qubits are selected to minimize errors.<br>


<p>3: Circuit Initialization<br>
Quantum and classical registers are initialized.<br>
Quantum Register: N + 1 qubits (1 for a control Bloch clock qubit, N for locations).<br>
Classical Register: N + 1 bits for measurement.<br>





<p>4: Bloch Clock Qubit Initialization<br>
The control qubit q_0​ is initialized in a superposition state: ∣q_0⟩ = (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)/sqrt(2)<br>
using a Hadamard gate: H ∣0⟩ = ∣+⟩<br>
    





<p>5: Location Qubits in Superposition <br>
Each location qubit q_i​ is placed into a superposition state: ∣qi​⟩ = (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)/sqrt(2)<br>
This represents all possible combinations of delivery sequences simultaneously:<br>
                             N<br>
∣ψ⟩ = ∣q_0​⟩ ⊗  ∏  (∣q_i​⟩)<br>
                             i = 1<br>


    




<p>6: Entanglement of Bloch Clock with Locations<br>
Dependencies between the Bloch clock q_0​ and each location q_i​ are simulated using controlled-X (CNOT) gates: CNOT(q_0​, q_i​)<br>
This ensures that the state of the Bloch clock influences all location qubits.<br>




    
<p>7: Encoding Energy Costs<br>
Energy consumption or travel costs are encoded as rotations on the Bloch sphere. For each location q_i​, a controlled rotation CR_x​ is applied: <br>
CR_x​(θ_i​)(q_i​, q_0​)<br>
where θ_i = π/(2i)​ defines the cost.<br>

<p>8: Evolution of the Bloch Clock<br>
The Bloch clock qubit q_0​ undergoes rotations along all axes to introduce quantum interference, simulating cost evolution:<br>
R_x​(π/8​), R_y​(π/8​​), R_z​(π/8​​)<br>



<p>9: Measurement of the Quantum State<br>
The quantum register is measured:<br>
Measure q_i → cr_i​<br>
This collapses the superposition into a classical state representing one potential route.<br>


<p>10: Transpilation and Execution<br>
The circuit is transpiled for ibm_brisbane. The experiment is executed with 16,384 shots to gather a statistical distribution of results.<br>


<p>11: Result Extraction<br>
Measured bitstrings represent potential delivery sequences. For example:<br>
110011: Drones visit locations 1, 2, 5, and 6.<br>
101010: Drones visit locations 1, 3, and 5.<br>
Frequencies of bitstrings indicate the likelihood of each route being optimal.<br>

    
<p>12: Results Visualization<br>
A histogram is plotted to visualize the frequency distribution of potential routes.
<br>

    
    
<p><center> Results:</center><br>

{<br>
"raw_counts": {<br>
"0110101": 135,<br>
"1110011": 127,<br>
"1001101": 77,<br>
"1100100": 108,<br>
"0111011": 215,<br>
"0100101": 115,<br>
"0100111": 252,<br>
"1110010": 204, ... }<br>

The bitstring 0100111 appears the most frequently, with a count of 252. This indicates that the algorithm consistently identifies this route as highly probable or optimal. Similarly, routes like 0111011 (215 counts) and 0110111 (229 counts) are also highly favored, pointing to a pattern of preferred routes among the measurements.
<br>
While certain routes dominate the measurements, there is a significant spread across other bitstrings, suggesting that the algorithm explores a diverse solution space. For example, routes like 1000001 and 1110001 have low counts (50 and 73), indicating that they are less optimal but still considered during the computation.<br>

The Frequency Distribution of Measured Bitstrings above (code below) shows the counts of all measured bitstrings, representing potential drone delivery routes. There is a clear variance in frequency, with some routes appearing significantly more often than others. The distribution tapers off as we move toward less frequent routes, suggesting that the quantum algorithm focuses on a subset of routes it deems more optimal. 
<br>
The Most Frequent Delivery Sequences above (code below) shows the top 10 most frequently measured bitstrings and their corresponding counts. Bitstring 0100111 dominates the measurements, with 252 counts, followed by 0111011 and 0110111 with 229 and 215 counts. These top 10 sequences represent the most likely optimal delivery routes, which drones can prioritize. By focusing on these routes, we can reduce computational overhead and streamline drone operations while maintaining high efficiency.
<br>
The Cumulative Distribution of Measured Counts above (code below) shows how the measured counts accumulate across all ranked bitstrings. The steep initial slope indicates that a small number of routes account for a large portion of the total measurements. The curve flattens as we include less frequent routes, which contribute minimally to the overall probability distribution. The quantum algorithm effectively concentrates on a small subset of highly probable routes, aligning with the goal of identifying optimal solutions efficiently.
<br>
The Heatmap of Delivery Sequence Patterns above (code below) visualizes the inclusion of locations (columns) across the most frequently measured bitstrings (rows).A 1 (dark blue) indicates that a location is included in the route, while a 0 (white) indicates it is skipped. Patterns in the heatmap reveal commonalities in which locations are visited together across different routes. Certain locations are consistently included in the top routes, suggesting that they are critical delivery points with high priority. Other locations appear sporadically, reflecting flexibility in optimizing drone energy consumption or accommodating variable delivery demands.<br>

        <div class="content-block">
<br>
The Distribution of Route Lengths (Hamming Weight) above (code below) shows the distribution of routes based on the number of locations visited (Hamming weight of bitstrings). The peak at 3 - 4 locations indicates that the quantum optimization algorithm favored routes that visited a moderate number of locations rather than extremes (all locations or none). This suggests that the cost function encoded in the circuit balances efficiency with coverage. Drones are optimized to visit a reasonable number of locations without overextending, which could save energy and time.
<br>
The Cumulative Probabilities of Top 10 Routes above (code below) shows that the cumulative probabilities of the top 10 routes show a gradual increase, indicating that no single route dominates. Instead, multiple routes have comparable probabilities of being optimal. This highlights flexibility in route selection. Drones could choose from several near optimal paths based on real world constraints (weather, traffic, etc).
<br>
The Frequency of Location Inclusion Across Routes above (code below) shows how frequently each location was included in the measured routes. Locations 1, 4, and 5 appear more frequently, suggesting they are central to most optimal routes. Locations with higher inclusion frequencies may correspond to high priority delivery points (densely populated areas or critical delivery hubs). This data could inform drone fleet allocation to ensure these locations are consistently covered.
<br>
In the Shannon Entropy of Measured Bitstrings above (code below), the Shannon entropy value of ~6.94 bits indicates high diversity in the bitstring distribution, meaning the quantum algorithm explored a wide range of routes. High entropy reflects a large exploration of the solution space, ensuring that the algorithm did not prematurely converge on suboptimal solutions. This ensures fairness and flexibility in drone route planning.</div>

The 3D Bar Plot of Top 10 Routes above (code below) shows the top 10 bitstrings (routes) with their respective counts. The counts represent how often these routes appeared in the measurements, indicating their likelihood of being optimal. 
<br>
The 3D Scatter Plot of Bitstring Probabilities above (code below) visualizes the probabilities of each bitstring (route) based on the measurements. It correlates the Hamming weight (number of locations visited) with the probability of the route. Routes with moderate Hamming weights (3 - 4 visited locations) have higher probabilities, indicating an optimized balance between energy consumption and coverage.
<br>
The Parallel Coordinates Plot of Top 10 Routes above (code below) shows the relationship between locations visited (1) or not (0) for the top 10 routes. Each line corresponds to a bitstring, and its path indicates whether a location is included in the route. This helps visualize which locations are commonly included or skipped in the top routes. High overlap in certain paths suggests key delivery hubs or regions that are critical in the optimization problem.
<br>
The 3D Surface Plot of Route Inclusion Frequencies above (code below) shows the inclusion frequencies of locations across all routes. Peaks in the plot indicate locations that are consistently included in many routes, while valleys represent less visited areas. High inclusion locations could correspond to high priority areas or regions with higher delivery demand.
<br>
In the end, the experiment successfully explored drone route optimization using quantum computing. By representing delivery locations as qubits and encoding travel distances and constraints, this circuit used quantum entanglement and superposition to evaluate multiple potential routes simultaneously. The optimization problem was designed to balance coverage (number of locations visited) with efficiency (energy consumption and travel time). The results gave the most efficient routes, the most frequently selected routes, key delivery hubs, and overall trends in the optimization process. <br>
